    A helper class that computes the weights for the actions based on the number of times the state-action pair was
    visited. The more exploited the state-action pair is, the lower the weight will be with respect to the other actions
    in the action space. The weights sum up to 1 and are computed with the following formula:
    w(a_i | s) = c(s, a_i)^{-t} / \sum_j c(s, a_j)^{-t}, where c(s, a) is the number of times the state-action pair
    (s, a) was visited (plus the epsilon), and t is the temperature parameter that may vary with the trajectory length.

    Params:
        epsilon: A small constant added to the count of the state-action pair.
        initial_temperature: The initial temperature parameter.
        current_temperature: The current temperature parameter.
        temperature_delta: The delta by which the temperature parameter is increased in every call of the
            `set_next_temperature` method.
